# PokeRestKt - application for springboot, kotlin and spock training

Ideas for features:
  1. Evolutions
  2. Duells - POST endpoint with request body: 2 pokemons and their levels
    analysis of their strenghts and vulnerabilities against each other
    return value - score of each pokemon in  a potential fight (probability?)
